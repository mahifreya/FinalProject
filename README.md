# FinalProject
This project is intended to assist a user in choosing the best sequence of metro lines and stations in order to get from their start station to final destination as quickly as possible.

# Final Project Instructions
In the file there should be two folders containing `.jar` files, the folder called `lib` and the folder called `json-20180813`. These folders must be added as `external libraries` to the project before compiling and running it. 

Once the folders have been added as external libraries, the program should compile and run normally.

When the program first runs it does take a few seconds to load because it needs to retrieve information from the internet, please be patient and do not worry.

After the GUI program pops up, please maximize the screen for the best viewing experience. 

There are drop down menus for both the starting and ending station. Please select any stations from these menus and then hit the `search` button on the bottom left of the screen.

This will cause the **A* algorithm** to run which may take a while. When the algorithm is done running, the path and the instructions for the user will be displayed on the screen.

Thank you and enjoy testing out our services!!
